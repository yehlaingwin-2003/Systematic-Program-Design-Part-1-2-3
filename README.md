# Systematic Program Design (SPD)

This repository contains my work from the **Systematic Program Design** course series by the University of British Columbia (UBC), originally offered on [edX](https://learning.edx.org/):

- [SPD Part 1 (SPD1x)](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+SPD1x+2T2015/home)  
- [SPD Part 2 (SPD2x)](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+SPD2x+2T2015/home)  
- [SPD Part 3 (SPD3x)](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+SPD3x+3T2015/home)
  
Although the courses are archived (no certificates or staff support), I completed all three parts for self-study and fundamentals practice.
👉 While learning SPD, I also referred to this helpful repo for structure and reference: [s7oev/spd](https://github.com/s7oev/spd)

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each folder usually contains:
- `problem-name-starter.rkt` → Starter code/problem statement  
- `problem-name-solution-mine.rkt` → My solution (Racket)  
- `problem-name-solution.rkt` → Official staff solution (for comparison)  
- `*.rkt~` → Temporary DrRacket backup (ignore)  
- Quizzes → Multiple choice/design quiz PDFs

## 🛠️ Tools
- **Language**: Racket (dialect of Lisp)  
- **IDE**: DrRacket

## 🎯 Purpose
I used this course series to:
- Strengthen **systematic problem-solving** habits (HtDF/HtDD/HtDW recipes)  
- Practice **functional programming** and recursion  
- Build a solid foundation for advanced computer science topics (algorithms, data structures, compilers)  

Although Racket itself isn’t widely used in industry, the skills and design recipes from SPD transfer directly to other programming languages such as **Python, Java, and C++**, making this course a valuable step in developing long-term programming fundamentals.

## 📌 Notes
- This repo is mainly for my **learning and practice**.  
- The solutions here are my own attempts (unless I noted otherwise), so they may not always be the most elegant.  
- If you’re also studying SPD, I’d encourage you to try the problems yourself first — that’s where the real learning happens!
