# 🧑‍💻 Systematic Program Design (SPD)

This repository contains my work from the **Systematic Program Design** course series by the University of British Columbia (UBC), originally offered on [edX](https://learning.edx.org/):

- [SPD Part 1 (SPD1x)](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+SPD1x+2T2015/home)  
- [SPD Part 2 (SPD2x)](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+SPD2x+2T2015/home)  
- [SPD Part 3 (SPD3x)](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:UBCx+SPD3x+3T2015/home)  

Although the courses are archived (no certificates or staff support), I completed all three parts for self-study and fundamentals practice.

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each folder usually contains:
- `problem-name-starter.rkt` → Starter code/problem statement  
- `problem-name-solution-mine.rkt` → My solution (Racket)  
- `problem-name-solution-mine-export.txt` → Text export of my solution  
- `problem-name-solution.rkt` → Official staff solution (for comparison)  
- `*.rkt~` → Temporary DrRacket backup (ignore)  
- Quizzes → Multiple choice/design quiz PDFs

## 🛠️ Tools
- **Language**: Racket (dialect of Lisp)  
- **IDE**: DrRacket

## 🎯 Purpose
I used this course series to:
- Strengthen **systematic problem-solving** habits (HtDF/HtDD/HtDW recipes)  
- Practice **functional programming** and recursion  
- Build a foundation for advanced CS topics (algorithms, data structures, compilers)  

Although Racket itself isn’t used in industry, the thinking skills and design recipes from SPD transfer directly to languages like **Python, Java, C++** — essential for FAANG-style interviews and real-world software engineering.

## 📌 Notes
- This repo is for **educational purposes only**.  
- All solutions are my own, unless explicitly marked as staff solutions.  
- If you’re studying SPD, I recommend solving problems yourself before checking my code.
